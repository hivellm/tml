// TML Standard Library
// Provides core functionality for all TML programs

// TODO: Full module system with `pub mod` declarations not yet implemented
// For now, individual files are used directly

// Note: In a full implementation, this would re-export all standard library modules
// Currently the compiler doesn't support:
// - pub mod declarations
// - Re-exporting from submodules with paths (option::{Maybe, Just, Nothing})

// Once module system is complete, restore full re-exports
