//! Global memory allocator interface.
//!
//! This module defines the GlobalAlloc behavior for custom global allocators.

// GlobalAlloc requires lowlevel intrinsics not yet supported.
// This file is kept for compatibility with the module structure.

// The behavior will be implemented when lowlevel block support is added.
