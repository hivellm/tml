# The TML Programming Language

*by HiveLLM*

This documentation assumes you are using TML 1.0 or later.

TML (To Machine Language) is a programming language designed specifically for
code generation and analysis by LLMs. It combines the safety of languages like
Rust with a more readable and LLM-friendly syntax.

The source code for this documentation and the TML compiler can be found at
