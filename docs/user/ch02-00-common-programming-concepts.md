# Common Programming Concepts

This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language
and how they work in TML. You'll learn about:

- Variables and mutability
- Basic data types
- Functions
- Comments
- Control flow (if/else, loops)

These concepts form the foundation of every TML program. Learning them
thoroughly will give you a strong base to build upon.

## Why These Concepts Matter

Understanding variables, types, and control flow is essential because:

1. **Variables** let you store and manipulate data
2. **Types** ensure your data is used correctly
3. **Functions** let you organize and reuse code
4. **Control flow** lets you make decisions and repeat actions

Let's dive in!
