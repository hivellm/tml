# Getting Started

Let's start your TML journey! There's a lot to learn, but every journey
starts somewhere. In this chapter, we'll:

- Install the TML compiler
- Write our first TML program
- Learn about the `tml` command line tool

## Installing TML

The first step is to install TML. You'll need a C++ compiler and LLVM/Clang
to build TML programs.

## Writing Your First Program

After installation, we'll write the traditional "Hello, World!" program.
This simple program will verify your installation is working correctly.

## Using the TML CLI

TML comes with a command-line tool that handles compiling and running
your programs. We'll learn the basic commands you'll use daily.
