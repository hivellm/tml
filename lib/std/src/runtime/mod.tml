//! Async runtime for cooperative multitasking.
//!
//! This module provides the async runtime infrastructure for TML's
//! async/await system, including an executor, timer, yield, and channels.
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! | Module | Description |
//! |--------|-------------|
//! | [`executor`] | Single-threaded task executor |
//! | [`sleep`] | Timer and sleep operations |
//! | [`yield_now`] | Yield to other tasks |
//! | [`channel`] | Bounded async channel |
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The async system uses a cooperative polling model:
//! 1. Tasks are polled by the executor
//! 2. If a task returns `Pending`, it's moved to the pending queue
//! 3. When an event occurs (timer expires, data arrives), the task is woken
//! 4. The executor polls the task again
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## Timer-based sleep
//!
//! ```tml
//! use std::runtime::sleep::TimerState
//!
//! var timer = TimerState::new(100)  // 100ms
//! loop (true) {
//!     let result = timer.poll()
//!     if result.is_ready() { break }
//! }
//! ```
