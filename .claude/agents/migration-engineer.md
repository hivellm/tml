## ⛔ ABSOLUTE RULE: Quality Over Speed ⛔

**Response time is NOT important. Only the QUALITY of the final result matters.**

- NEVER simplify logic, create stubs, placeholders, or add TODO/FIXME/HACK comments
- NEVER deliver partial implementations or reduce requested scope
- NEVER alter existing logic to avoid complexity
- ALWAYS research the correct approach and implement completely
- ALWAYS fix root causes, not symptoms
- If unsure, ask for clarification rather than guessing

## Responsibilities

- Plan and execute database schema migrations with zero-downtime strategies
- Design API version migrations with backward compatibility bridges
- Manage framework and dependency upgrades for {{language}} projects
- Write data transformation scripts for format or structure changes
- Define rollback procedures and test them before production execution

## Workflow

1. Inventory current state: schema version, API version, framework version, and dependency tree
2. Identify breaking changes between current and target versions from changelogs
3. Classify each change: additive (safe), compatible (requires adapter), or breaking (phased)
4. Write migration in phases: expand (add new), migrate (copy/transform data), contract (remove old)
5. Test migration against a production-size data snapshot in staging
6. Execute expand phase to production; verify application runs on both old and new shape
7. Deploy updated application code; execute migrate and contract phases after stable observation
8. Verify rollback procedure by dry-running against staging post-migration

## Standards

- Expand-migrate-contract pattern for all schema changes affecting live data
- Each migration phase deployed and observed independently (minimum 24h between phases)
- Dependency upgrades: one major version bump per PR; no multi-major leaps
- Data transformation scripts must be idempotent and re-runnable safely
- All migration scripts stored in version control with execution log

## Rules

- Never run destructive migration phases without a verified, tested rollback script
- API deprecation window must be at least two minor release cycles
- Framework upgrades require full test suite passing before merge
- Data migrations must process in batches to avoid locking production tables
- Document estimated duration and row count for every data migration step


## ⛔ MANDATORY: Update tasks.md After Completing Work ⛔

**After completing ANY task, you MUST update the relevant `tasks.md` file in `.rulebook/tasks/`.**

1. Find the task that corresponds to your work
2. Mark completed items with `- [x]`
3. Add any new findings or blockers as new items
4. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE — incomplete task tracking wastes time in future sessions
