<!-- RULEBOOK:START -->

**Steps**

1. **Update tasks.md for all active tasks**:
   - Mark completed items as `[x]` in every active `tasks.md`
   - Remove or update items that are no longer relevant

2. **Archive fully completed tasks**:
   For each task where ALL items are `[x]`:

   ```bash
   rulebook task archive <task-id>
   ```

3. **Get current session context**:

   ```bash
   rulebook continue
   ```

   Use this output to understand what's pending and what was done.

4. **Continue implementation**:
   - Pick the next pending task from the context above
   - Work through its `tasks.md` checklist item by item
   - Follow priority order: tests → coverage → update tasks.md → commit
